## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

In the last week, I basically talked to the manager of the RPI collegiate store. During the conversation, I realized that it was impossible
to get access to the API of the collegiate store because the techinical team for our collegiate store is in Chicago and it was too hard to 
contact them. I also learnt more about php on youtube.


## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

Take pictures and videos of the collegiate store and work on the back-end of the project.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

Difficulty of contacting the technical team made it hard for us to get the dataset of the collegiate store

## Notes

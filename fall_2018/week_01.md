## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

In the last week, I worked on getting acccess to the API of the collegiate store, I go directly to the union administration, and talked to the officers, they said I had to find manager in the collegiate store, so I went to the book store, got the email address of the<br />
manager, and sent him an email.<br />
Since I'm part of the back-end team of the group, I continued learning manage database by php from learning tutorials on youtube.
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

Get access to the API of the book store, and start to finish some basic back-end code for the project.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

The blocking can be the lagging of the reply of emails from the officer, since we did not get sufficient data for our project, it is hard to start build our project.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
